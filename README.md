# Description
A fork of [Remote Torrent Adder](https://github.com/bogenpirat/remote-torrent-adder)

Chrome started blocking [Remote Torrent Adder](https://github.com/bogenpirat/remote-torrent-adder) because it's using too wide permissions in the manifest

This extension dynamically requests permissions to the sites when user clicks to add torrent.

There is also a button "Request Permission" in the settings next to torrent service.\
Click it to grant permission to access torrent service URL
